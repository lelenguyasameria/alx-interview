this is the lockboxes and concepts to look are 

Concepts Needed:

    Lists and List Manipulation:
        Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
        Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)

    Graph Theory Basics:
        Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
        Graph Theory (Khan Academy)

    Algorithmic Complexity:
        Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
        Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)

    Recursion:
        Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
        Recursion in Python (Real Python)

    Queue and Stack:
        Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
        Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)

    Set Operations:
        Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
        Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)
