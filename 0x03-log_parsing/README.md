For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:

Concepts Needed:
File I/O in Python:

Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
Python Input and Output
Signal Handling in Python:

Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
Python Signal Handling
Data Processing:

Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
Aggregating data to compute summaries.
Regular Expressions:

Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
Python Regular Expressions
Dictionaries in Python:

Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
Python Dictionaries
Exception Handling:

Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
Python Exceptions
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
