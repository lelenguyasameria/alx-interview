For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:
Concepts Needed:

    File I/O in Python:
        Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
        Python Input and Output

    Signal Handling in Python:
        Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
        Python Signal Handling

    Data Processing:
        Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
        Aggregating data to compute summaries.

    Regular Expressions:
        Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
        Python Regular Expressions

    Dictionaries in Python:
        Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
        Python Dictionaries

    Exception Handling:
        Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
        Python Exceptions

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
