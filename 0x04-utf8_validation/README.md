Concepts Needed:

    Bitwise Operations in Python:
        Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
        Python Bitwise Operators

    UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:
        Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
        Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
        UTF-8 Wikipedia
        Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle
        The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets

    Data Representation:
        How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
        Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

    List Manipulation in Python:
        Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
        Python Lists

    Boolean Logic:
        Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project, effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
